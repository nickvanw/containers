==========

This repo has a smattering of various Dockerfiles that I've made for one reason or another. Mostly, it's because I couldn't find an open source version that worked for me or that I liked. 

These are not guaranteed in the slightest to work for anyone else, and usually don't expose any configuration options beyond what I needed. PRs are welcome if you can make it work for you.
